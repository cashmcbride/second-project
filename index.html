    <h1>Changing the font colors</h1>
    <h2>Different media size, different color</h2>
    <p>When changing the font colors for each size of media it's important to make sure your css file is properly linked to your html file before you get started. Having a template is helpful and can be created with ease inside your local documents folder or by using the command line and creating a new repo.</p>
